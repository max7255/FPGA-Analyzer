WARNING:NgdBuild:931 - The value of SIM_DEVICE on instance
   'clocks/u_pll_adv_125' of type PLL_ADV has been changed from 'VIRTEX5' to
   'SPARTAN6' to correct post-ngdbuild and timing simulation for this primitive.
    In order for functional simulation to be correct, the value of SIM_DEVICE
   should be changed in this same manner in the source netlist or constraint
   file.
